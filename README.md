# My Book Shelf Organizer

This project was created using create react app with TypeScript and react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality.

## How it works

This app represents a status board with columns and items for organizing simple reading process. 

Columns are for the statuses of the items (On the shelf, Reading, Read) and items are representations of books.

Each book is color-coded and font-coded depending on its genre. 

App provides a way to easily manage books, edit its data and when book is read - add review and rating. 

All the data is saved to your browser local storage and will only be visible for you. 

## What`s next?

1. Books archive.
2. Separate mobile view.
